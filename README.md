  ## Description
  This Homework assignment was completed for Unit Twenty of the U of M Bootcamp, to practice creating a React app, [constructed with Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), that will serve as my professional coding portfolio. The site will allow users to view my posted work, displayed via components.

  ## Usage
  To 'use' this project, I just recommend you view the deployed version.

  ## Contributing
  If you want to contribute to this project - particularly if you are a styling guru who wants to teach me some tricks that will work in React, hit me up! I'm always trying to learn from people who know more.

  ## Tests
  This project can and should be tested using the deployed version.
